# Mouse-Viral-Study
A mouse viral study using SVM (Support Vector Machine) algorithm would involve analyzing viral data from mouse samples, extracting relevant features and then training a SVM model on those features to classify the samples as infected or not infected with a specific virus. The trained model can then be used to classify new samples with high accuracy.
